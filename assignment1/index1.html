                <p>Hello! I'm Maddie, the person behind the screen. Meaning that not only is the artwork mine, so is the code! I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado but lived in Washington State to attend college. I plan to move around the country, try out new cities, and visit as many museums as possible since my full time job allows me to work remotely.</p>
                <p>During the day I work for a online marketing company designing one-page websites, sending email marketing campaigns, and managing content. When I'm not in front of a computer screen I like to hike, draw and paint, and drink IPA's.</p>
